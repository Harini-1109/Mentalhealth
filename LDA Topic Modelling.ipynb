I have a history of this :P \\n// It's really on and off but it mainly happens in the winter time. I get highly anxious also going out anywhere during these periods of time, I get suspicious and paranoid of everyone or anything. I usually end up isolating myself in my room until it's all over and eat way less then I should, I also get highly irritable and emotional. Like one time my mom sent me to the store for milk and I started crying before and then in the store because I thought I was going to be killed and that I was watched.\\nI believe during these periods that I am being 'watched' by the government or something of higher power and that I'm a gerbil for studies or something like that. I thought that the news wasn't real and that it was used just to put fear in me- which it did. And that people were also 'fake' or sort of figures of my imagination and that they were trying to manipulate me. This usually happens for anywhere from a day to a weekish. I'm also an insomniac if that means anything :P Anyways yes thats some background info!//\\nSo I was sitting in class, feeling highly anxious of everything and everyone, but I guess I just got to my breaking point in math class (second block) while talking to my friend. I don't remember lots, it's a bit blurry to me but what had happened was I explained to him that he wasn't real. That I knew everything wasn't 'real' and that I had figured out the plan that I was a 'test subject' of everything. I told him things such as that life didn't matter because we were all going to die so we might just die right now. I was being extremely loud when talking about it too because I was so confused(?) and unaware of how I was behaving. The teacher just sat in the back of the class like nothing was happening and the other kids just were kind of confused. I kind of just explained to him that I didn't understand why we were alive because there was no point and that when we die, no one will remember us. It's really odd to me when I recap these events because I'm not suicidal at all so it was really out of character. I ended up skipping the rest of the afternoon that day on my friends request that I go home and sleep for a bit. When I talk to my friend about what happened, he tells me that he was scared I was going to kill myself but he was very confused on what to do because despite talking loud I didn't have much emotion at all besides that. \\nI do try to talk to a parent about it, and when I talked to my mom about my feelings of nothing being real she said that \\\"kids feel like that all the time\\\" but when I discuss it amongst my friends they can't relate. A couple months later my mom did take me to the family doctor but when he asked me questions I kept saying no to everyone because I felt really awkward but we did find out I'm an insomniac. I tried to go to the doctor again with my grandma a month or two after that and when she asked what I was there for I said I felt paranoid sometimes and she called me crazy. So I just asked him about my eczema instead because she said not to talk to him about it. I don't know what to do. I'm so awkward to go to the doctors and discuss this with him, but it's really starting to affect my personal and school life. I have had these things happen before but never to the point I have had them in school or have had them affect me going to stores by myself.  I don't know what to do. Sorry for the wall of text. ((started happening maybe 2 years ago?? 14 years when first started and now I'm 16 years old.))\\nAny advice is appreciated!!\",\n          \"Hi all,\\n\\nI made a throwaway account as my main account is one that my friends and family know about. I've dealt with anxiety for around eight years. I had full blown panic attacks over the thought of non-existence for about 9 months straight and eventually got a hold of it. They've come back over time, with one stretch being about a month long, but I've learned to somewhat manage it when it happens. I still, from time to time, grapple with the fear of death though.\\n\\nLast year, I had about a week's worth of panic attacks and anxiety when I stumbled into a thread on /r/environment where someone asked how doomed we were. This absolutely wrecked me for about two weeks. I still don't know what made the pain and fear fade away, but it never really left my mind. \\n\\nI became somewhat obsessive about the energy usage of myself and others to the point that I would watch a video of an activist interviewing someone and think \\\"the microphones are using fossil fuels right now.\\\" Absolutely microscopic stuff. It didn't kill me, but it made me obsessive. I made changes in my life over the year - I've greatly reduced the amount of meat I eat (and I eat no red meat whatsoever now), changed out all of the lights to be LED, started to grow my own food, buy mostly local when I can, etc. I live in St. Louis, so biking and public transportation are not really great options here, but I have cut down on travel.\\n\\nFast forward to this week. I have the whole week off work, and had plans to finish a book I was reading, watch some movies, etc. I was alone in the house, and all of the sudden, for no real reason, my anxiety about the environment fired up really fast again, which has now lasted for about a week.\\n\\nI'm 28 and I am absolutely terrified. I read things from people who are optimistic about climate change (Al Gore), to people who seem a little more in the middle (Bill McKibben, Eric Holthaus), to people who seem downright ready to be in the doomsday bunkers (Guy McPherson). I have always known that the situation wasn't great, but despite my personal belief that humans will survive, the idea of total collapse of our civilization by 2100 or before has crippled and paralyzed me. I feel absolutely helpless because the problem is so much bigger than myself and overwhelming. I'm a naturally pessimistic person, which makes me believe that humans won't change fast enough, no matter how much the rest of the world that cares about this does.\\n\\nThis has caused me to wonder why I should want to live in a world down the road that is headed towards total collapse. I am struggling to get out of bed. I have barely eaten. I feel like I'm the only one who sees this and is reacting appropriately. Even people who are on the front lines seem to somehow be able to live lives, which is even crazier when I consider that some of them have children, who will really see the brunt of this.\\n\\n/r/anxiety, does anyone share these feelings or have gone through them before? What can I do to ease this? What hope do I have? I'm seeing a therapist later today, but I just needed to get this out there.\\n\\n(sidenote: I am crossposting this to other subreddits)\",\n          \"I've been withdrawing from medicines lately (effexor, zyprexa and cymbalta) not all at the same time mind you, but they have been close together in withdraw. \\nThursday I had a major panic attack, so bad that I needed to take extra of my kolonopin and had to skip work Friday. It only lasted about 30mins, but I was shaky and felt sick the rest of the night. Now it's saturday, not quite two full days after the panic attack started and I still feel as I like to describe 'like a chihuahua', or like I had too much caffeine! I haven't had any except for a small amount of chocolate yesterday...it feels like I've been on the edge of a panic attack since my initial one. \\nI'm not sure what to do!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Subreddit\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Anxiety\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
